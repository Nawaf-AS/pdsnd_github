## How to Run
Run the script using: `python bikeshare.py`

## Author
Created by Nawaf AlShahrani as part of the Udacity Nanodegree program.

## Motivation
This project was created as part of the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree to practice Python programming, data analysis, and user interaction through command-line inputs. The goal is to gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets while building a functional tool for data exploration.

## Future Improvements
- Add support for additional cities and datasets
- Implement graphical data visualizations
- Create a web-based version of the tool
- Allow exporting results to CSV or Excel
